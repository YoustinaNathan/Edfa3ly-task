#in this project you can search for products from a front cataloge by choosing a category and then filter the result using price, color or rate or even filter using all

#this project was made using reactjs, HTML, CSS and bootsrtap.

#this is very simple to use only you need to follow the instructions, and here it is:
First: you need to choose a category by checking the radio buttom not the whole card just the radio buttom 
Then: the result will immediatly show for you, after that you can filter the result using on or more of the filters (price, color or rate).

#if you choosed a price for example and you want to change it by different value, then you need to reload the page.

#there should be a rating stars in every card, i wrote the code but there something not right, and i can't figure it out. and a clear buttom should be included in every filter
but the time is limited.

#this project is working well. you only need to include node_modules to it.
